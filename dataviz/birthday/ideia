<title> The Birthday Experiment

<section id= "Intro">
	How likely is to have 2 or more people in the same room that are born in the same day?

	<plot id="firstPlot"> waffle plot com 2 hominhus preenchidos


<section id= "Assumptions"> 
	Before we answer that, we will make 2 assumptions:
	1. The probability to born is equal any day
	2. We will consider that every year has 365 days
	

<section id= "TheExperiment">
	If we use a little bit of frenquentist statistics theory, we can assume that if we repeat a experiment a "lot" of times, then the frequency of occorying a event is close to his probability (thats sound a little boring, I know, but have faith!)

To be more clear, lets simulate 1000 rooms with 20 persons
	<plot id="secondPlot">  1000 caixas sem preenchimento (fica parado na tela)

<texto rolante> In our simulation, 405 rooms have at least 2 persons that are born in the same day (40,5%). That's surprinsinlgy high, right?

RERUN SIMULATION? - feature talvez

	<sai da tela o secondPlot>

	<plot id="thirdPlot" class="empty-curve"> curva maneira
<texto rolante> If we simulate rooms with diferent sizes we get that curve
	<plot id="thirdPlot" class="with-curve"> animacao de entrada da curva

<texto rolante> With 23 persons in the room, the probability of at least a match is about 50%!
	<plot id="thirdPlot" class="highlight23">

<texto rolante> With 50 persons in the room, the probability increase to about 90%!
	<plot id="thirdPlot" class="highlight50">

<texto rolante> hover over the curve to explore the simulations results.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long (kind of) time since I start to formulate the idea for a blog to share my statistical/analytical stuff, more precisely since I was in the second year of my bachelor degree (2016). Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot (in multiple fields), so, finally I&amp;rsquo;m able to make this thing happen!
As a statistician, I was molded in the R/S-plus world, so the most convenient way to make this site (that I&amp;rsquo;ve found) was using the bookdown package for R, wich is a really great tool to build blogs like this, based in the Hugo framework, and have a nice integration with the R-studio IDE.
For this blog I&amp;rsquo;m using the AllinOne theme by Orianna with some modifications.</description>
